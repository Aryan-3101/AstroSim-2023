Hey 
These are the programs I wrote for the gravitational well simulation.

AstroWork.cpp is the file which does the computations for our simulation.
If you want to explore, just change the initial values while initializing 
the class objects. And type in the file name in which you want to store data.

This data can be simulated using the file simulator.py. Just run the file, and
type the name of the textfile you want to simulate.
This simulation is just the 2D projection of what data was feeded in.
You can resize the window and change the limits of the axes if needed.
Make sure you have the libraries installed already.  

ucm4.txt stores the tragectory for Unifrom Circular Motion.
pb1.txt stores the tragectory when the planet has escape velocity.
